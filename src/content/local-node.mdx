# Running a Local Node

Once your project is initialized, you can spin up a local DagDev node. This node simulates a full BlockDAG network on your machine.

## Starting the Node

Run the following command in your project root:

```bash
dagdev node
```

You should see output indicating that the node has started:

```text
Starting local GHOSTDAG node...
✔ Network: local-dev | Port: 16110
✔ Miner worker started (4 threads)
INFO: Genesis block created 0x00...00
INFO: Block added 0x3f...a2 (Blue Score: 1)
```

## Interacting with the Node

### Via RPC
The node exposes a JSON-RPC interface at `http://localhost:16110`. You can send standard Ethereum RPC calls as well as custom DagDev commands.

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' http://localhost:16110
```

### Visualizing
While the node is running, you can open the visualizer (usually at `http://localhost:3000` if running the dev server, or launched via `dagdev visualize`) to connect to your local node and watch the graph grow in real-time.

## Stopping the Node

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. The node state is ephemeral by default — restarting it will create a fresh DAG from a new genesis block.

To persist state between runs (useful for long-term testing):

```bash
dagdev node --persist ./data
```
