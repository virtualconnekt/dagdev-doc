# What is DagDev

> DagDev is a CLI-first development framework for BlockDAG-based blockchains. It provides a local DAG execution environment, parallel block simulation, and EVM compatibility.

DagDev allows protocol researchers and infrastructure engineers to spin up deterministic DAG networks locally, visualize the ledger structure, and test consensus modifications in real-time.

## Key Features

*   **Local DAG execution environment**: Spin up a network with thousands of blocks in seconds.
*   **Parallel block simulation**: Simulate mining on multiple tips (blue set) concurrently.
*   **EVM compatibility**: Deploy standard Solidity contracts on a DAG-based ledger.

## Why BlockDAG?

Unlike traditional blockchains that arrange blocks in a single chain, a **BlockDAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph) allows blocks to reference multiple parents. This enables:

1.  **High Throughput**: Parallel block creation without orphans.
2.  **Fast Confirmations**: GHOSTDAG ordering provides quick probabilistic finality.
3.  **Decentralization**: Lowers the barrier for mining by utilizing inclusive protocols.

## Architecture Overview

DagDev consists of three main components:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CLI** | The primary interface for developers (`dagdev`). |
| **DRE** | Dag Runtime Environment for managing local nodes. |
| **Visualizer** | A web-based tool for inspecting the DAG graph. |
