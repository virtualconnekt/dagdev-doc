# Installation

Getting started with DagDev is straightforward. As a CLI-first tool, it installs globally on your machine to provide the `dagdev` command everywhere.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following requirements met:

*   **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher.
*   **npm**: Version 9.0.0 or higher (usually comes with Node.js).
*   **Git**: Required for scaffolding new projects.
*   **Rust (Optional)**: Only needed if you plan to compile the DRE from source. The standard installation uses pre-compiled binaries.

## Install via NPM

To install the latest stable version globally:

```bash
npm install -g dagdev
```

This will download the CLI package and the appropriate DRE binary for your operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows).

## Verifying Installation

Once installed, verify that the command is available in your PATH:

```bash
dagdev --version
```

You should see an output similar to:

```text
dagdev version 0.8.2
dre version 1.4.0 (ghostdag-v2)
```

## Updating

To update to the latest version:

```bash
npm update -g dagdev
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" on Linux/macOS
If you encounter permission errors during installation:
1.  **Do not use sudo** if possible. It can mess with file ownership.
2.  Fix your npm permissions or use a node version manager like `nvm`.
3.  If you must, use `sudo npm install -g dagdev`.

### "Command not found"
Ensure your global node modules folder is in your system PATH.
- On **Linux/macOS**: Add `export PATH=$PATH:$(npm prefix -g)/bin` to your shell profile (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).
- On **Windows**: Check your Environment Variables.
