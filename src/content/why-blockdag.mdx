# Why BlockDAG?

The limitations of traditional blockchains—specifically the **Nakamoto Consensus** used by Bitcoin—stem from their sequential nature. To prevent forks and double-spending, blocks must be created slowly enough that latency doesn't cause the network to de-sync.

**DagDev** is built on the premise that parallelism is the only path to Layer 1 scalability without centralized compromises.

## The Trilemma of Traditional Chains

In sequential blockchains:
1.  **Orphans are Waste**: If two miners solve a block at the same time, one is discarded (orphaned). This wastes energy and security.
2.  **Low Throughput**: To minimize orphans, block intervals must be large (e.g., 10 minutes in Bitcoin).
3.  **High Latency**: Confirmation requires waiting for multiple sequential blocks.

## The BlockDAG Solution

A **BlockDAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph) changes the fundamental rule: **blocks can have multiple parents**.

### 1. Inclusive Mining (No Orphans)
When two miners produce blocks simultaneously, both are added to the graph. They reference the same tips (parents). This structure forms a DAG rather than a chain.
- **Security**: The "chain" is now a "mesh" of proof-of-work.
- **Efficiency**: No work is wasted. All valid blocks contribute to network security.

### 2. High Throughput via Parallelism
Since the network doesn't need to wait for full propagation before the next block is mined, block times can be reduced drastically (e.g., 1 block/second or faster).

### 3. Fast Confirmations with GHOSTDAG
The core innovation enabling this is the **GHOSTDAG** consensus protocol (a variant of PHANTOM).
- It orders the DAG into a linear sequence retroactively.
- It distinguishes between **Blue Blocks** (well-connected, honest majority) and **Red Blocks** (attackers or poorly connected).
- **Result**: You get the speed of a mesh with the strict ordering of a chain.

    <p className="text-sm text-slate-400">
        DagDev networks are parameterized by <code>k</code>, which defines the maximum "width" of the DAG (how many parallel blocks are allowed before anticone checks kick in). A higher <code>k</code> allows for more parallel throughput but requires higher bandwidth.
